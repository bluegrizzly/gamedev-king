        "GDDs matter most when you\u2019re collaborating.",
        "A good game design doc lets you make faster decisions later.",
        "A game design document, often called a GDD, is a detailed internal document that describes a video game\u2019s design.",
        "If you only remember one thing, remember this: A GDD turns a game idea into an actionable plan the whole team can follow.",
        "It\u2019s important to remember that lots of people from many different disciplines may refer to a GDD \u2014\u00a0from artists and level designers, to engineers, composers and even the marketing team.",
        "So creating a document that\u2019s easy for everyone to understand is really important.",
        "But even a solo developer may find a GDD useful, as a later reference point for decisions they took early in the process, or in case they bring in a second developer to help share the work.",
        "GDDs can include any relevant material for the game."
